a8,r8  Zero Page, Relative
       This mode is used only with the bit-test branch instructions (BBS and BCC). The second byte of the instruction specifies the zero page memory to be tested. The third byte of the instruction is the offset, whose range is -128 to 127 bytes, referenced to the location of the next instruction.
