$FF81  CINT    Initialize Screen Editor and VIC-II Chip
               
               The start of the routine appears to be a patch that was added to later
               versions of the Kernal.  It first calls the old routine at 58648
               ($E518).  This initializes the VIC-II chip to the default values, sets
               the keyboard as the input device and the screen as the output device,
               initializes the cursor flash variables, builds the screen line link
               table, clears the screen, and homes the cursor.  The new code then
               checks the VIC Interrupt register to see if the conditions for a
               Raster Compare IRQ have been fulfilled.  Since the Raster Register was
               initialized to 311, that can only occur when using a PAL system (NTSC
               screens do not have that many scan lines).  The PAL/NTSC register at
               678 ($2A6) is set on the basis of the outcome of this test.  The CIA #1
               Timer A is then set to cause an IRQ interrupt every sixtieth of a
               second, using the prescaler figures for a PAL or NTSC system, as
               appropriate.
               
$FF84  IOINIT  Initialize CIA I/O Devices
               
               This routine initializes the Complex Interface Adapter (CIA)
               devices, and turns the volume of the SID chip off.  As part of this
               initialization, it sets CIA #1 Timer A to cause an IRQ interrupt every
               sixtieth of a second.
               
$FF87  RAMTAS  Perform RAM Test and Set Pointers to the Top and Bottom of RAM
               
               This routine performs a number of initialization tasks.
               
               First, it clears Pages 0, 2, and 3 of memory to zeros.  Next, it sets
               the tape buffer pointer to address 828 ($33C), and performs a
               nondestructive test of RAM from 1024 ($400) up.  When it reaches a
               non-RAM address (presumably the BASIC ROM at 40960 ($A000)), that
               address is placed in the top of memory pointer at 643-4 ($283-4).  The
               bottom of memory pointer at 641-2 ($281-2) is set to point to address
               2048 ($800), which is the beginning of BASIC program text.  Finally,
               the pointer to screen memory at 648 ($288) is set to 4, which lets the
               Operating System know that screen memory starts at 1024 ($400).
               
$FF8A  RESTOR  Restore RAM Vectors for Default I/O Routines
               
               This routine sets the values for the 16 RAM vectors to the interrupt and
               important Kernal I/O routines in the table that starts at 788 ($314)
               to the standard values held in the ROM table at 64816 ($FD30).
               
$FF8D  VECTOR  Set the RAM Vector Table from the Table Pointed to by .X and .Y
               
               This routine is used to read or change the values for the 16 RAM vectors to the
               interrupt and important Kernal I/O routines in the table that starts
               at 788 ($314).  If the Carry flag is set when the routine is called,
               the current value of the 16 vectors will be stored at a table whose
               address is pointed to by the values in the .X and .Y registers.  If
               the Carry flag is cleared, the RAM vectors will be loaded from the
               table whose address is pointed to by the .X and .Y registers.  Since
               this routine can change the vectors for the IRQ and NMI interrupts,
               you might expect that the Interrupt disable flag would be set at its
               beginning.  Such is not the case, however, and therefore it would be
               wise to execute an SEI before calling it and a CLI afterwards (as the
               power-on RESET routine does) just to be safe.
               
$FF90  SETMSG  Set the Message Control Flag
               
               This routine controls the printing of error messages and control
               messages by the Kernal.  It Bit 6 is set to 1 (bit value of 64),
               Kernal control messages can be printed.  These messages include
               SEARCHING FOR, LOADING, and the like.  If Bit 6 is cleared to 0, these
               messages will not be printed (BASIC will clear this bit when a program
               is running so that the messages do not appear when I/O is performed
               from a program).  Setting Bit 6 will not suppress the PRESS PLAY ON
               TAPE or PRESS PLAY & RECORD messages, however.
               
               If Bit 7 is set to 1 (bit value of 128), Kernal error messages can be
               printed.  If Bit 7 is set to 0, those error messages (for example, I/O
               ERROR #nn) will be suppressed.  Note that BASIC has its own set of
               error messages (such as FILE NOT FOUND ERROR) which it uses in
               preference to the Kernal's message.
               
$FF93  SECOND  Send a Secondary Address to a Device on the Serial Bus after LISTEN
               
               This routine sends a secondary address from the
               Accumulator to the device on the serial bus that has just been
               commanded to LISTEN.  This is usually done to give the device more
               particular instructions on how the I/O is to be carried out before
               information is sent.
               
$FF96  TKSA    Send a Secondary Address to a Device on the Serial Bus after TALK
               
               This routine sends a secondary address from the
               Accumulator to the device on the serial bus that has just been
               commanded to TALK.  This is usually done to give the device more
               particular instructions on how the I/O is to be carried out before
               information is sent.
               
$FF99  MEMTOP  Read/Set Top of RAM Pointer
               
               This routine can be used to either read or set the top of RAM pointer.  If
               called with the Carry flag set, the address in the pointer will be
               loaded into the .X and .Y registers.  If called with the Carry flag
               cleared, the pointer will be changed to the address found in the .X
               and .Y registers.
               
$FF9C  MEMBOT  Read/Set Bottom of RAM Pointer
               
               This routine can be used to either read or set the bottom of RAM pointer.  If
               called with the Carry flag set, the address in the pointer will be
               loaded into the .X and .Y registers.  If called with the Carry flag
               cleared, the pointer will be changed to the address found in the .X
               and .Y registers.
               
$FF9F  SCNKEY  Read the Keyboard
               
               This subroutine is called by the IRQ interrupt handler above to read
               the keyboard device which is connected to CIA #1 (see entry for 56320
               ($DC00) for details on how to read the keyboard).
               
               This routine returns the keycode of the key
               currently being pressed in 203 ($CB), sets the shift/control flag if
               appropriate, and jumps through the vector at 655 ($28F) to the routine
               that sets up the proper table to translate the keycode to PETASCII.
               It concludes with the next routine, which places the PETASCII value of
               the character in the keyboard buffer.
               
$FFA2  SETTMO  Set Time-Out Flag for IEEE Bus
               
               This routine sets the time-out flag for the IEEE bus.  When timeouts
               are enabled, the Commodore will wait for a device for 64 milliseconds,
               and if it does not receive a response to its signal it will issue a
               time-out error.  Loading the Accumulator with a value less than 128
               and calling this routine will enable time-outs, while using a value
               over 128 will disable time-outs.
               
               This routine is for use only with the Commodore IEEE add-on card,
               which at the time of this writing was not yet available.
               
$FFA5  ACPTR   Receive a Byte of Data from a Device on the Serial Bus
               
               When called, this routine will get a byte of data from
               the current TALKer on the serial bus and store it in the Accumulator.
               In order to receive the data, the device must have previously been
               sent a command to TALK and a secondary address if it needs one.
               
$FFA8  CIOUT   Send a Byte to an I/O Device over the Serial Bus

               This routine's purpose is to send a byte of data over
               the serial bus.  In order for the data to be received, the serial
               device must have first been commanded to LISTEN and been given a
               secondary address if necessary.  This routine always buffers the
               current character, and defers sending it until the next byte is
               buffered.  When the UNLISTEN command is sent, the last byte will be
               sent with an End or Identify (EOI).
               
$FFAB  UNTLK   Send UNTALK to a Device on the Serial Bus
               
               When called, this routine sends the UNTALK code (95, $5F) on the
               serial bus.  This commands any TALKer on the bus to stop sending data.
               
$FFAE  UNLSN   Send UNLISTED to a Device on the Serial Bus
               
               This routine sends the UNLISTEN code (63, $3F) on the serial
               bus.  This commands any LISTENers to get off the serial bus, and frees
               up the bus for other users.
               
$FFB1  LISTEN  Send LISTEN to a Device on the Serial Bus

               When called, this routine ORs the device number in the
               Accumulator with the LISTEN code (32, $20) and sends it on the serial
               bus.  This commands the device to LISTEN.
               
$FFB4  TALK    Send TALK to a Device on the Serial Bus
               
               When called, this routine ORs the device number in the
               Accumulator with the TALK code (64, $40) and sends it on the serial
               bus.  This commands the device to TALK.
               
$FFB7  READST  Read the I/O Status Word
               
               Whenever an I/O error occurs, a bit of the Status Word is set to
               indicate what the problem was.  This routine allows you to read the
               status word (it is returned in the Accumulator).  If the device was
               the RS-232, its status register is read and cleared to zero.  For the
               meanings of the various status codes, see the entry for location 144
               ($90) or 663 ($297) for the RS-232 device.
               
$FFBA  SETLFS  Set Logical File Number, Device Number, and Secondary Address
               
               This routine stores the value in the Accumulator in the location which holds the
               current logical file number, the value in the .X register is put in
               the location that holds the current device number, and the value in
               the .Y register is stored in the location that holds the current
               secondary address.  If no secondary address is used, the .Y register
               should be set to 255 ($FF).  It is necessary to set the values of the
               current file number, device number, and secondary address before you
               OPEN a file, or LOAD or SAVE.
               
$FFBD  SETNAM  Set Filename Parameters
               
               This routine puts the value in the Accumulator into the location which stores
               the number of characters in the filename, and sets the pointer to the
               address of the ASCII text of the filename from the .X and .Y
               registers.  This sets up the filename for the OPEN, LOAD, or SAVE
               routine.
               
$FFC0  OPEN    Open a Logical I/O File
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 794 ($31A).  This routine
               assigns a logical file to a device, so that it can be used for
               Input/Output operations.  In order to specify the logical file number,
               the device number, and the secondary address if any, the SETLFS
               routine must first be called.  Likewise, in order to designate the
               filename, the SETNAM routine must be used first.  After these two
               routines are called, OPEN is then called.
               
$FFC3  CLOSE   Close a Logical I/O File
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 796 ($31C).  It is used to
               close a logical file after all I/O operations involving that file have
               been completed.  This is accomplished by loading the Accumulator with
               the logical file number of the file to be closed, and calling this
               routine.
               
               Closing an RS-232 file will de-allocate space at the top of memory for
               the receiving and transmit buffers.  Closing a cassette file that was
               opened for writing will force the last block to be written to
               cassette, even if it is not a full 192 bytes.  Closing a serial bus
               device will send an UNLISTEN command on the bus.  Remember, it is
               necessary to properly CLOSE a cassette or disk data file in order to
               retrieve the file later.
               
               For all types of files, CLOSE removes the file's entry from the tables
               of logical files, device, and secondary address at 601, 611, and 621
               ($259, $263, $26D), and moves all higher entries in the table down one
               space.
               
$FFC6  CHKIN   Designate a Logical File As the Current Input Channel
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 798 ($31E).  If you wish to
               get data from any device other than the keyboard, this routine must be
               called after OPENing the device, before you can get a data byte with
               the CHRIN or GETIN routine.  When called, the routine will designate
               the logical file whose file number is in the .X register as the
               current file, its device as the current device, and its secondary
               address as the current secondary address.  If the device on the
               channel is a serial device, which requires a TALK command and
               sometimes a secondary address, this routine will send them over the
               serial bus.
               
$FFC9  CHKOUT  Designate a Logical File As the Current Output Channel
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 800 ($320).  If you wish to
               output data to any device other than the screen, this routine must be
               called after OPENing the device, and before you output a data byte
               with the CHROUT routine.  When called, the routine will designate the
               logical file whose file number is in the .X register as the current
               file, its device as the current device, and its secondary address as
               the current secondary address.  If the device on the channel uses the
               serial bus, and therefore requires a LISTEN command and possibly a
               secondary address, this information will be sent on the bus.
               
$FFCC  CLRCHN  Restore Current Input and Output Devices to the Default Devices
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 802 ($322).  It sets the
               current input device to the keyboard, and the current output device to
               the screen.  Also, if the current input device was formerly a serial
               device, the routine sends it an UNTALK command on the serial bus, and
               if a serial device was formerly the current output device, the routine
               sends it an UNLISTEN command.
               
$FFCF  CHRIN   Input a Character from the Current Device
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 804 ($324).  Its function is
               to get a character from the current input device (whose device number
               is stored at 153 ($99)).  This device must first have been OPENed and
               then designated as the input channel by the CHKIN routine.
               
               When this routine is called, the next byte of data available from this
               device is returned in the Accumulator.  The only exception is the
               routine for the keyboard device (which is the default input device).
               It the keyboard is the current input device, this routine blinks the
               cursor, fetches characters from the keyboard buffer, and echoes them
               to the screen until a carriage return is encountered.  When a carriage
               return is round, the routine sets a flag to indicate the length of the
               last logical line before the return character, and reads the first
               character of this logical line from the screen.
               
               Subsequent calls to this routine will cause the next character in the
               line to be read from the screen and returned in the Accumulator, until
               the carriage return character is returned to indicate the end of the
               line.  Any call after this character is received will start the whole
               process over again.
               
               Note that only the last logical line before the carriage return is
               used.  Any time you type in more than 80 characters, a new logical
               line is started.  This routine will ignore any characters on the old
               logical line, and process only the most recent 80-character group.
               
$FFD2  CHROUT  Output a Byte
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 806 ($326).
               It is probably one of the best known and most used Kernal routines,
               because it sends the character in the Accumulator to the current
               output device.  Unless a device has been OPENed and designated as the
               current output channel using the CHKOUT routine, the character is
               printed to the screen, which is the default output device.  If the
               cassette is the current device, outputting a byte will only add it to
               the buffer.  No actual transmission of data will occur until the
               192-byte buffer is full.
               
$FFD5  LOAD    Load RAM from a Device
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 816 ($330).  LOAD is used to
               transfer data from a device directly to RAM.  It can also be used to
               verify RAM, comparing its contents to those of a disk or tape file.
               To choose between these operations you must set the Accumulator with a
               0 for LOAD, or a 1 for VERIFY.
               
               Since the LOAD routine performs an OPEN, it must be preceded by a call
               to the SETLFS routine to specify the logical file number, device
               number, and secondary address, and a call to the SETNAM routine to
               specify the filename (a LOAD from tape can be performed without a
               filename being specified).  Then the .X and .Y registers should be set
               with the starting address for the load, and the LOAD routine called.
               If the secondary address specified was a 1, this starting address will
               be ignored, and the header information will be used to supply the load
               address.  If the secondary address was a 0, the address supplied by
               the call will be used.  In either case, upon return from the
               subroutine, the .X and .Y registers will contain the address of the
               highest RAM location that was loaded.
               
$FFD8  SAVE    Save RAM to a Device
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 818 ($332).  SAVE is used to
               transfer data directly from RAM to an I/O device.  Since the SAVE
               routine performs an OPEN, it must be preceded by a call to the SETLFS
               routine to specify the logical file number, device number, and
               secondary address, and a call to the SETNAM routine to specify the
               filename (although a SAVE to the cassette can be performed without
               giving a filename).  A Page 0 pointer to the starting address of the
               area to be saved should be set up, with the low byte of the address
               first.  The accumulator should be loaded with the Page 0 offset of
               that pointer, then the .X and .Y registers should be set with the
               ending address for the save, and the SAVE routine called.
               
$FFDB  SETTIM  Set the Software Clock from the .A, .X, and .Y Registers
               
               This routine performs the reverse operation from RDTIM, storing the value in the
               .Y register into location 160 ($A0), the .X register into 161 ($A1),
               and the Accumulator into 162 ($A2).  Interrupts are first disabled, to
               make sure that the clock will not be updated while being set.
               
$FFDE  RDTIM   Read the Time From the Software Clock into the .A, .X, and .Y Registers
               
               It reads the software clock (which counts sixtieths of a second) into
               the internal registers.  The .Y register contains the most significant
               byte (from location 160 ($A0)), the .X register contains the middle
               byte (from location 161 ($A1)), and the Accumulator contains the least
               significant byte (from location 162 ($A2)).
               
$FFE1  STOP    Test STOP Key
               
               This routine is vectored through RAM at 808 ($328).  The routine checks to see
               if the STOP key was pressed during the last UDTIM call.  If it was,
               the Zero flag is set to 1, the CLRCHN routine is called to set the
               input and output devices back to the keyboard and screen, and the
               keyboard queue is emptied.
               
$FFE4  GETIN   Get One Byte from the Input Device
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 810 ($32A).
               Its function is to get a character from the current input device
               (whose device number is stored at 153 ($99)).  In practice, it
               operates identically to the CHRIN routine below for all devices except
               for the keyboard.  If the keyboard is the current input device, this
               routine gets one character from the keyboard buffer at 631 ($277).  It
               depends on the IRQ interrupt routine to rad the keyboard and put
               characters into the buffer.
               
$FFE7  CLALL   Close All Logical I/O Files
               
               The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 812 ($32C).  It closes all
               open files, by resetting the index into open files at 152 ($98) to
               zero.  It then falls through to the next routine, which restores the
               default I/O devices.
               
$FFEA  UDTIM   Update the Software Clock and Check for the STOP Key
               
               This routine is normally called by the IRQ interrupt handler once every sixtieth
               of a second.  It adds one to the value in the three-byte software
               jiffy clock at 160-162 ($A0-$A2), and sets the clock back to zero when
               it reaches the 24 hour point.  In addition, it scans the keyboard row
               in which the STOP key is located, and stores the current value of that
               key in location 145 ($91).  This variable is used by the STOP routine
               which checks for the STOP key.
               
$FFED  SCREEN  Store Number of Screen Rows and Columns in .Y and .X
               
               When called, this subroutine returns the number of screen columns in
               the .X register, and the number of screen rows in .Y.  Thus, a program
               can detect the screen format of the machine on which it is running,
               and make sure that text output is formatted accordingly.
               
               The present version of this routine loads the .X register with 40
               ($28) and the .Y register with 25 ($19).
               
$FFF0  PLOT    Read/Set Location of the Cursor
               
               The routine allows the user to read or set the position of the cursor.
               If the carry flag is set with the SEC instruction before calling this
               subroutine, cursor column (X position) will be returned in the .X
               register, and the cursor row (Y position) will be returned in the .Y
               register.  If the carry flag is cleared with a CLC instruction before
               entering this routine, and the .Y and .X registers are loaded with the
               desired row and column positions respectively, this routine will set
               the cursor position accordingly.
               
               The current read routine loads .X and .Y from locations 214 ($D6) and
               211 ($D3) respectively.  The cursor set routine stores .X and .Y in
               these locations, and calls the routine that sets the screen pointers
               at 58732 ($E56C).
               
               The user can access this routine from BASIC by loading the .X, .Y, and
               .P register values desired to the save area starting at 780 ($30C).
               
$FFF3  IOBASE  Store Base Address of Memory-Mapped I/O Devices in .X and .Y Registers
               
               When called, this routine sets the .X register to the low byte of the
               base address of the memory-mapped I/O devices, and puts the high byte
               in the .Y register.  This allows a user to set up a zero-page pointer
               to the device, and to load and store indirectly through that pointer.
               A program which uses this method, rather than directly accessing such
               devices could be made to function without change on future Commodore
               models, even though the I/O chips may be addressed at different
               locations.  This of course assumes that the CIA or a similar chip will
               be used.  This routine is of limited value for creating software that
               is compatible with both the VIC-20 and the 64 because of the
               differences in the VIA I/O chip that the VIC uses.
               
               The current version of this routine loads the .X register with a 0,
               and the .Y register with 220 ($DC), thus pointing to CIA #1, which is
               at 56320 ($DC00).
