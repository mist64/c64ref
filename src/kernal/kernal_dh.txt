$FFA5  ACPTR   Get a byte from serial bus
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               **Setup routines**: TALK, TKSA
               
               The vector is JMP EE13/EF19. At EE13/EF19 the com-
               puter goes through a handshake sequence with the serial bus.
               During this sequence, the EOI handshake is performed if the
               serial clock input line does not go low within 250 micro-
               seconds as expected. If the EOI handshake sequence is per-
               formed, the routine sets the EOI status in the I/O status word,
               location 90. It can set the time-out status in the status word if
               serial clock in fails to go low within a certain time range.
               
               If the preparation to receive handshaking signals detects
               no problems, and if the eight bits are received without
               handshaking error, the routine returns the byte received in the
               accumulator.
               
               **Exit conditions**: The accumulator contains the byte received from the serial
               bus.
               
               
$FFC6  CHKIN   Open channel for input
               
               **Called by**: JSR at E11E/E11B in BASIC's Set Input Device.
               
               **Setup routines**: OPEN
               
               **Entry requirements**: The X register should contain the logical file number.
               
               JMP (031E) with a default of F20E/F2C7. If the logical file
               is in the logical file number table, the routine obtains the de-
               vice number and secondary address for this logical file from
               the corresponding entries in the device number and secondary
               address tables. If the logical file is not in the logical file num-
               ber table, it displays FILE NOT OPEN, and returns with carry
               set and accumulator set to 3.
               
               If the current device is the screen or the keyboard, the
               routine stores 0 for the keyboard or 3 for the screen in 99, the
               location holding the device number of the current input de-
               vice. You don't have to use OPEN and CHRIN to input from
               the keyboard.
               
               If the current device is the tape, the routine also checks
               the secondary address. If the current secondary address is not
               $60, the routine displays the NOT INPUT FILE message, and
               returns with carry set and accumulator set to 6. If the current
               secondary address is $60, then location 99 is set to 1 to make
               tape the current input device. OPEN does an ORA $60 of the
               secondary address.
               
               If the current device is a serial device, it opens the input
               channel by sending a TALK command to the device, and send-
               ing the secondary address if the value for secondary address
               held in B9 is < 128 (decimal). If the serial device does not re-
               spond, it displays the DEVICE NOT PRESENT error message
               and returns with carry set and accumulator set to 5. Other-
               wise, it stores the serial device number in 99.
               
               If the current device is RS-232, the routine opens an RS-
               232 input channel. This RS-232 routine sets the current input
               device, location 99, to 2 for RS-232, then handles either the 3-
               line handshaking or the x-line handshaking opening sequence.
               
               
$F20E          CHKIN Execution F20E/F2C7-F236/F2EF
               
               **Called by**:
               Indirect JMP through (031E) from Kernal CHKIN vector at FFC6.
               
               If the current logical file passed in the X register is in the
               logical file number table, obtain its corresponding device num-
               ber and secondary address from the device number and
               secondary address tables. If it is not in the logical file number
               table, exit with FILE NOT OPEN error message.
               
               If the device is the screen or the keyboard, set location 99,
               the current input device number, from BA, the current device
               number, and exit.
               
               If the current device is an RS-232 device, JMP to the
               Open RS-232 Device routine.
               
               If the current device is a serial device, JMP to the Open
               Serial Input Channel routine.
               
               If the current device is tape, see if the secondary address
               indicates reading from tape. If not, JMP to display the NOT
               INPUT FILE message.
               
               Store the current device number in the input device num-
               ber, 99, CLC, and exit.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. JSR F30F/F3CF to see if the logical file number in the X
                  register exists. If the logical file passed in the X register is
                  not in the logical file number table, JMP F701/F784 to FILE
                  NOT OPEN error message, set accumulator to 3, set the
                  carry, and exit.
               2. JSR F31F/F3DF to set the current logical file number in B8,
                  the current device number in BA, and the current secondary
                  address in B9 from the tables for the logical file, device
                  number, and secondary address.
               3. If the current device, BA, is the keyboard (0), or the screen
                  (3), branch to step 8.
               4. If the current device number is > 3, the current device is a
                  serial device; branch to F237/F2F0 to open a logical file for
                  a serial device.
               5. If the current device is an RS-232 device, JMP F04D/F116
                  to open an RS-232 logical file as an input channel.
               6. If the current device is tape, see if the secondary address is
                  $60. If the secondary address is $60, branch to step 8. The
                  secondary address of $60 is set during the OPEN Execution
                  routine when the secondary address is ORed with $60.
               7. If the secondary address is not $60, JMP F70A/F78D to dis-
                  play the NOT INPUT FILE message and exit with the accu-
                  mulator set to 6 and the carry set.
               8. STA (the current device number is in the accumulator) into
                  99, the input device number.
               9. CLC and RTS.
               
               
$FFC9  CHKOUT  Open channel for output
               
               **Called by**: JSR at E4AE/E115 in BASIC's Set Output Device.
               
               **Entry requirements**: Set X register to logical file number.
               
               JMP (0320) with default of F250/F309. If the logical file is
               in the logical file number table, obtain the device number and
               secondary address for this logical file from the corresponding
               entries in the device number and secondary address tables. If
               the logical file is not in the logical file number table, display
               the FILE NOT OPEN message, and return with carry set and
               accumulator set to 3.
               
               If the current device is the keyboard, display the NOT
               OUTPUT FILE message, and return with carry set and accu-
               mulator set to 7.
               
               If the current device is the screen, just set 9A, the current
               output device, to 3, and exit. You do not have to call OPEN
               and CHROUT to display on the screen.
               
               If the current device is tape, also check the secondary ad-
               dress. If the secondary address is not $61, display the NOT
               OUTPUT FILE message, and return with carry set and accu-
               mulator set to 7. If the current secondary address is $61, set
               9A to 1 for tape. Note: OPEN does an ORA $60 of the
               secondary address.
               
               If the current device is a serial device, open the output
               channel for a serial device. Do this by commanding the cur-
               rent device to listen. Then for secondary addresses < 128, set
               the serial attention output line high. If the serial device does
               not handshake as expected, display DEVICE NOT PRESENT,
               and return with carry set and accumulator set to 5. Otherwise,
               set 9A to the serial device number.
               
               If the current device is RS-232, then open an RS-232 out-
               put channel. This routine sets 9A to 2, and then it handles the
               3-line or x-line handshaking sequence.
               
               
$F250          CHKOUT Execution F250/F309-F278/F331
               
               **Called by**: Indirect JMP through (0320) from Kernal CHKOUT vector at
               FFC9.
               
               If the logical file number passed in the accumulator at en-
               try is not in the logical file table, display the FILE NOT OPEN
               error message.
               
               If the logical file is in the file number table, obtain the
               current device number and secondary address for this logical
               file.
               
               If the device is the keyboard, display the NOT OUTPUT
               FILE error message.
               
               If the device is the screen, store the device number in the
               output device number, 9A, and exit.
               
               If the device is a serial device, branch to Open Serial Out-
               put Channel.
               
               If the device number is 2 (RS-232), jump to Open RS-232
               Output Channel.
               
               If the device is tape, the secondary address must not be
               $60 because this indicates read from tape. If $60 is found, dis-
               play the NOT OUTPUT FILE error message. If the secondary
               address is legal, set the output device number, 9A, to the
               value 1.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. JSR F30F/F3CF to see if the logical file number passed in
                  the X register is in the logical file number table. If not, JMP
                  F701/F784 to display the FILE NOT OPEN error message
                  and return with 3 in accumulator and carry set, then exit.
               2. JSR F31F/F3DF to obtain the current device number and
                  the current secondary address from their respective tables.
               3. If the current device is the keyboard, JMP F70D/F790 to
                  display the NOT OUTPUT FILE error message, set accu-
                  mulator to 7, set carry, and exit.
               4. If the current device is the screen, store the device number
                  in 9A, the output device number, then CLC, and exit.
               5. If the current device is a serial device, branch to F279/F332
                  to Open Serial Output Channel.
               6. If the current device is an RS-232 device, JMP EFE1/F0BC
                  to Open RS-232 Output Channel.
               7. If the current device is tape, the secondary address must not
                  be $60 (read tape). If the secondary address is $60, JMP to
                  NOT OUTPUT FILE error, set accumulator to 7, set carry,
                  and exit. If the secondary address is legal, set the output de-
                  vice number, 9A, to 1 (tape).
               8. CLC and RTS.
               
               
$FFCF  CHRIN   Get a byte from input channel
               
               **Called by**: JSR at E112/E10F in BASIC's Input a Character.
               
               **Setup routines**: OPEN, CHKIN (not required in retrieving from keyboard).
               
               JMP (0324) with default of F157/F20E.
               
               If the current input device, 99, is tape, then return the
               next byte from the tape buffer. Also, read one byte ahead to
               see if the next byte is zero, indicating end of file, and if true,
               set end-of-file status in 90.
               
               If the current input device, 99, is a serial device, the accu-
               mulator returns the byte received over the serial bus. How-
               ever, if there are any I/O status errors, return with
               accumulator set to $0D
               
               If the current input device, 99, is RS-232, return with the
               next character from the RS-232 receive buffer. However, if the
               receive buffer is empty, the RS-232 routine on the VIC just
               loops until the receive buffer contains a character. The VIC
               can hang in an infinite loop if the RS-232 receive buffer never
               gets another character. If the receive buffer is empty on the 64,
               the routine returns with $0D in the accumulator.
               
               If the current input device is the keyboard, each character
               typed (except for control characters such as the cursor keys) is
               displayed on the screen until the unshifted RETURN is en-
               tered. Once an unshifted RETURN is typed, reset the input
               routine to retrieve a character from this screen line. After each
               character is retrieved from the screen line, increment the
               pointer to the character being retrieved in this logical line. The
               screen POKE code is converted to the equivalent ASCII code,
               which is returned in the accumulator. If the end of the screen
               line has been reached, then return $0D, the ASCII code for a
               carriage return. The screen editor routines limit the size of a
               logical line to 80/88 characters. The way this CHRIN from the
               keyboard is typically used is to fill a buffer as BASIC does.
               BASIC calls the CHRIN routine to fill the BASIC input buffer
               at 0200. The BASIC routine keeps putting characters in the
               buffer until CHRIN retrieves a carriage return (ASCII $0D).
               
               If the current input device, 99, is the screen, then return
               the ASCII code for the screen character in the current logical
               line pointed to by D3, the column the cursor is on. D3 is then
               incremented to point to the next character in the line. If D3
               has reached the end of the line, return $0D signifying carriage
               return, and set D0 to 0 to force the next CHRIN to come from
               the keyboard.
               
               When doing CHRIN from the keyboard, the keyboard
               routine uses this CHRIN from the screen once the carriage re-
               turn has been entered. After processing the screen characters,
               the screen CHRIN then resets a flag at D0 to 0 to force input
               from the keyboard for the next CHRIN.
               
               **Exit conditions**: Accumulator holds byte returned from channel.
               
               
$F157          Determine Input Device F157/F20E-F178/F22F
               
               **Called by**: Indirect JMP through (0324) from Kernal CHRIN vector at
               FFCF.
               
               Call the appropriate character input routine based on the
               input device number, 99.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. If 99 is set to 0 (keyboard), save D3 in CA, save D6 in C9,
                  and JMP E632/E64F (see chapter 7) to receive a character
                  from the keyboard.
               2. If 99 is set to 3 (screen), store 3 in DO, save D5 in C8, and
                  JMP E632/E64F (see chapter 7) to receive a character from
                  the screen.
               3. If 99 is set to 2 (RS-232), branch to F1B8/F26F (see chapter
                  9) to receive a character from the RS-232 device.
               4. If the value in 99 > 3 (serial), branch to F1AD/F264 (see
                  chapter 8) to receive a character from the serial device.
               5. If 99 is set to 1 (tape), fall through to F179/F230 to receive
                  a character from tape.
               
               
$FFD2  CHROUT  Send a byte to output channel
               
               **Called by**: JSR at E10C/E109 in BASIC's Output a Character, JSR at

               Handler, JSR at F759/F7DC in Find Next Tape Header.
               
               **Setup routines**: OPEN, CHKOUT (not required if output device is the screen).
               
               **Entry requirements**: Accumulator should contain the character to be output, in
               CBM ASCII. JMP (0326) with a default of F1CA/F27A.
               
               If 9A, the current output device, is the screen (3), the
               ASCII code is displayed on the screen unless the ASCII code is
               a screen control function (cursor key, DELete, INSerT, and so
               on). If the character is a control code, the routine performs the
               action. If the ASCII code is a valid screen display code, the
               code is displayed on the screen at the current cursor position
               and then the cursor is advanced to the next position on the
               screen.
               
               If the current output device, 9A, is a serial device, (> 3),
               then JMP EDDD/EEE4 to send the character to all open serial
               devices. When sending a character to a serial device, a one-
               byte buffer, 95, is maintained. If this buffer is empty, the
               character to be output is simply stored in the buffer. If the
               buffer already contains a character, the routine sends the
               character from the buffer onto the serial bus and stores the
               character to be output in the buffer. When the serial file is
               closed or the serial device is commanded to unlisten, the final
               byte in the buffer is sent.
               
               If the current output device, 9A, is RS-232 (2), the charac-
               ter to be output is stored in the RS-232 transmit buffer, and
               transmission is started if this is the first byte to be sent.
               
               If the current output device, 9A, is tape (1), store the
               character in the currently available position in the tape buffer
               and increment the index to the available position in the tape
               buffer. Once the index is set to 192, write the tape buffer to
               tape. Then set the first byte of the tape buffer to 2 (identifica-
               tion for a data buffer) and reset the index to point to the sec-
               ond byte of the tape buffer.
               
               Although the character to be output is in ASCII code for
               output to the screen, this is not the case for RS-232, serial, or
               tape. For example, if you are storing bytes to tape containing a
               code other than ASCII, CHROUT will send them to the tape
               buffer. For the screen, though, the 64/VIC screen editor is set
               up to convert ASCII codes to screen codes or screen functions,
               and would not function well if you did not use ASCII.

               **Operation**:
               
               1. If the output device is the screen, JMP E716/E742 (see
                  chapter 7) to output a character to the screen.
               2. If the output device is a serial device, JMP EDDD/EEE4 (see
                  chapter 8) to output a character to the serial device.
               3. If the output device is an RS-232 device, branch to

                  232 device.
               4. If the output device is tape, fall through to F1E5/F28F (see

               JMP FF5B to initialize the VIC-II (6567) chip registers,
               clear the screen, set the cursor pointer, initialize the screen line
               link table, set the PAL/NTSC flag, set value for CIA #1 timer
               A, enable interrupts for CIA #1 timer A, and start timer A.
               
               This Kernal jump instruction is only available on the 64.
               The nearest equivalent on the VIC is to JSR E518 to set the
               VIC (6560-6561) chip registers, clear the screen, set the cursor
               pointers, and initialize the screen line link table. The 6560 and
               6561 chips are, respectively, the NTSC and PAL versions of
               the VIC's video chip. The VIC equivalent of CINT for enabling
               the IRQ timer interrupt is to JMP FE39 to enable VIA #2 timer
               1 interrupts and to set a timer 1 value.
               
               Thus, a VIC version might be something like this:
               
               JMP 02A1
               02A1 JSR E518
               02A4 JSR FE39
               02A7 RTS
               
               CINT, or its VIC equivalent, is only needed if you write
               an autostart cartridge program and need to use the screen edi-
               tor or IRQ timer A/timer 1 interrupts. If no autostart cartridge
               exists, the 64/VIC performs the actions in CINT during system
               reset.

               address)
               
               **Entry requirements**: Accumulator should contain character to output. JMP EDDD/
               EEE4 to execute the Send Serial Byte Deferred routine.
               
               When sending a character to a serial device, the routine
               maintains a one byte buffer at 95. If this buffer is empty, the
               character to be output is simply stored in the buffer. If the
               buffer already contains a character, the character from the
               buffer is sent onto the serial bus and the character to be out-
               put is stored in the buffer. When the serial file is closed or the
               serial device commanded to unlisten, the final byte in the
               buffer is sent. The character is sent to all open devices on the
               serial bus.

               If the logical file number in the accumulator is found in
               the logical file number table, also retrieve the current device
               number from the device number table and the secondary ad-
               dress from the secondary address table.
               
               Then, execute the appropriate CLOSE routine for this cur-
               rent device.
               
               If accessing a serial device, for secondary addresses < 128
               (decimal), command the current device to LISTEN, send a
               CLOSE secondary address, and command the serial device to
               UNLISTEN. For secondary addresses > 128, this close se-
               quence is omitted.
               
               For an RS-232 device, bring the transmitted data line
               high, which is the idle state for RS-232 communications. Also,
               reset the pointers to the end of memory by reclaiming the
               space used for the RS-232 transmit and receive buffers.
               
               When closing a logical tape file, determine whether writ-

               For all types of devices, a common CLOSE exit is used.
               The number of open files, 98, is decremented, and the entry for
               this logical file is deleted from the logical file number table, the
               device number table, and the secondary address table.

               Upon entry, the accumulator contains the logical file num-
               ber to be closed. First, it calls a routine to determine if the
               logical file number is in the logical file number table. If the
               number is not in the table, then it will exit with carry clear. If
               the number is in the table, then it will retrieve the current de-
               vice number and secondary address corresponding to this file.
               
               Push the current index into the tables corresponding to
               the logical file number onto the stack. Determine the type of
               device the logical file is using and branch to the appropriate
               routine for closing screen, keyboard, serial, or tape devices, or
               fall through to following code for closing RS-232 devices.
               
               **Entry requirements**:
               Accumulator should contain the number of the logical file to
               be closed.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. JSR F314/F3D4 to see if the logical file number is in the
                  logical file number table. Return with X as the index into
                  table corresponding to this logical file if it exists; return with
                  Z = 1 (detected with BEQ) if the logical file is found.
               2. If the file is not found CLC and RTS.
               3. If the file is found, then JSR F31F/F3DF to retrieve the cur-
                  rent device number, BA, the current secondary address, B9,
                  and the current logical file number, B8, from the tables for
                  these with entries corresponding to the location of current
                  logical file number in the logical file number table.
               4. Transfer index into tables to accumulator and push on stack
                  for later retrieval by the individual CLOSE routines for RS-
                  232 and serial devices.
               5. If current device is the keyboard or screen, branch to
                  F2F1/F3B1 to decrement number of open files and remove
                  current file entry from the three tables.
               6. If current device is a serial device, branch to F2EE/F3AE for
                  a JMP to the routine to close a serial device.
               7. If current device is tape, branch to F2C8/F38D to close tape
                  files.
               8. If current device is RS-232, fall through to the routine at

               The index into the file tables for the current logical file is
               retrieved from the stack (except for the alternate entry from
               RS-232 which has already pulled it from the stack).
               
               The number of open files, 98, is decremented and com-
               pared to the index into the file tables. If equal, the current
               logical file is the last entry in the file table. In this case, there
               is no need to delete the actual entries in the tables since the
               pointer to the tables will now cause the next OPEN to over-
               write these entries.
               
               If the current logical file index is not equal to the number
               of open files (after the decrement), replace the current entries
               of the logical file number, device number, and secondary ad-
               dress tables with the last entries in the table. As the order
               within a particular table is unimportant, this rearrangement
               effectively deletes the current entries for the logical file, de-
               vice, and secondary address.
               Entry conditions:
               Index into file tables for current logical file is pulled from the
               stack at entry.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. Pull index into file tables for current logical file from stack.
               2. Transfer the index into the tables to X register.
               3. Decrement the number of open files (plus one), location 98.
               4. If X register equals the value in 98, the logical file being
                  closed is the last entry in the tables. Since 98 points to the
                  next available space in the tables, the next OPEN will over-
                  write the entries for this current logical file. Thus, just CLC
                  and RTS.
               5. If the number of open files (plus one) after decrement is not
                  equal to the value in the X register, the current logical file
                  being closed is not the last entry in the table. In this case,
                  move the last entries in the three tables (device number,

$FFE4  GETIN   Retrieve character from channel

               JMP(032A) with a default of F13E/F1F5.
               
               When retrieving characters from the keyboard, if any
               characters are in the keyboard buffer, the first character (an
               ASCII value) in the buffer is returned in the accumulator, and
               the rest of the characters are moved up one position in the
               buffer. If no characters are in the keyboard buffer, return with
               accumulator cleared to 0.
               
               You would use GETIN to retrieve the first character in the
               keyboard buffer. Contrast this to CHRIN, which does not re-
               trieve anything until RETURN is entered, then returns a
               character from the logical screen line.
               
               If retrieving from device 2, RS-232, see if the RS-232 re-
               ceive buffer contains any characters. If it is empty, return with
               accumulator set to 0. If it contains characters, return with
               accumulator containing next character in the receive buffer and
               increment the pointer into the receive buffer.
               
               If retrieving from channel 3 (the screen), channels >= 4
               (serial devices), or channel 1 (tape), do the same routines for
               GETIN that CHRIN does for these devices.
               
               For screen GETIN, return the ASCII code for the screen
               character in the current logical line pointed to by D3, the col-
               umn the cursor is on. D3 is then incremented to point to the
               next character in the line. If D3 is on the end of the line, re-
               turn the ASCII code $0D for return.
               
               For serial GETIN, the accumulator returns the byte re-
               ceived over the serial bus. However, if any I/O status errors
               occur, return with accumulator containing $0D.
               
               For tape GETIN, return the next byte from the tape buffer.
               Also, read one byte ahead to see if the next byte is zero, in-
               dicating end of file, and if true, set end-of-file status in 90.

               **Called by**: Indirect JMP through (032A) from Kernal GETIN vector at
               FFE4.
               
               This routine first determines if the current input device is
               the keyboard. If not, GETIN falls through to F14E/F205 for an
               RS-232 device or branches to F166/F21D for other devices
               using the same routines as are used by CHRIN.
               
               If the current input device is the keyboard and if the key-
               board buffer contains characters, JMP E5B4/E5CF to retrieve
               the first character from the keyboard buffer.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. If 99, the current input device, is not 0 (the keyboard),
                  branch to step 5.
               2. If 99 is 0 for the keyboard, see if any characters are in the
                  keyboard buffer as indicated by C6, the number of charac-
                  ters in the keyboard buffer.
               3. If no characters are in the keyboard buffer, just CLC and
                  RTS, thus returning with the accumulator set to 0.
               4. If characters do exist in the keyboard buffer, disable IRQ
                  interrupts and JMP E5B4/E5CF to retrieve the first character
                  from the keyboard buffer and exit.
               5. If the current input device, 99, is 2 for RS-232, fall through
                  to F14E/F205 for the routine to get characters from RS-232.
               6. If the current input device is neither 0 nor 2, branch to
                  F166/F21D to get a character from other devices. F166/F21D
                  is located in the Determine Input Device routine used by
                  CHRIN; thus, other devices (tape, screen, serial) perform
                  the same routines for both GETIN and CHRIN.
               
               
$FFF3  IOBASE  Return base address of I/O registers
               
               **Called by**: JSR at E09E/E09B BASIC's in RND
               
               JMP E500.
               
               This routine returns (to the X and Y registers) the address
               of the start of the I/O registers that control the 6526
               CIA/6522 VIA chips. You can write programs that refer to the
               I/O registers without knowing the exact address of the I/O
               register. To write a program in this manner, you would call
               IOBASE to get the starting address of the I/O registers and
               add an index to the particular I/O register to which you are
               referring.
               
               IOBASE for the VIC returns with X register set to $10 and
               Y register set to $91 (the address of the first register of VIA #1
               is 9110). IOBASE for the 64 returns with X register set to $00
               and Y register set to $DC (the address of the first register of
               CIA #1 is DC00). By calling IOBASE, you can determine both
               the starting address of the I/O registers and which computer
               the program is running on. Thus, your program could test
               which computer it is running on and read or write to the
               appropriate I/O register for this computer, giving you the abil-
               ity to write one program that works on both the 64 and the
               VIC. You still will have to know what the CIA/VIA registers
               do and how to modify them, since what works for a VIA reg-
               ister does not necessarily work the same way on the
               corresponding CIA register.
               
               BASIC's RND uses this routine to access the CIA/VIA
               timer registers in generating a random number.
               
               
$FF84  IOINIT  Initialize I/O devices
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               JMP FDA3 to initialize the CIA registers, the 6510 I/O
               data registers, the SID chip registers, start CIA #1 timer A, en-
               able CIA #1 timer A interrupts, and set the serial clock output
               line high.
               
               The closest equivalent to this routine on the VIC is JMP
               FDF9 to initialize the 6522 registers, set VIA #2 timer 1 value,
               start timer 1, and enable timer 1 interrupts.
               
               Since these routines are called during system reset, the
               main use for IOINIT is for an autostart cartridge that wants to
               use the same I/O settings that the Kernal normally uses.
               
               
$FFB1  LISTEN  Send listen with attention to serial devices
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               JMP ED0C/EE17.
               
               At ED0C/EE17 the accumulator, which contains the de-
               vice number, is ORed with $20, turning on bit 5 to prepare to
               send a LISTEN command on the serial data output line. The
               device number should be 0-31 (decimal). (If you specify a
               value > 31, you mess up the high nybble which is used for
               sending commands on the serial bus.)
               
               RS-232 interrupts are disabled.
               
               Finally, the LISTEN command for this device is sent on
               the serial bus. To send the LISTEN, the 64/VIC brings the se-
               rial attention output line low to cause all devices on the serial
               bus to listen for a command coming on the bus.
               
               
$FFD5  LOAD    LOAD/VERIFY to RAM
               
               **Called by**: JSR at E175/E172 in BASIC's LOAD /VERIFY.
               
               **Setup routines**: SETLFS, SETNAM
               
               **Entry requirements**:
               Accumulator should be set to 0 for LOAD; accumulator set to
               1 for VERIFY.
               
               If relocatable load desired: Set X register to the low byte
               of load starting address, and Y register to the high byte of load
               starting address.
               
               JMP F49E/F542 to store the X register and Y register in
               (C3), the starting address of the load, and then JMP(0330)
               with a default of F4A5/F549.
               
               At F4A5/F549, determine the device. The keyboard,
               screen, and RS-232 are illegal devices.
               
               For a serial device you must specify a filename. If you
               don't, the MISSING FILE NAME error message is displayed.
               With a valid filename, the computer commands the current se-
               rial device to listen and sends the secondary address of $60,
               indicating a load, followed by the filename. Then it tells the
               device to unlisten. Next, it tells the current serial device to
               talk, sends the current secondary address of $60, and receives
               a byte from the serial bus. If the I/O status word indicates the
               byte was not returned fast enough, a read time-out has oc-
               curred and the FILE NOT FOUND error message is displayed.
               The first two bytes received from the serial device are used as
               a pointer to the start of the load area (AE). However, if a
               secondary address of 0 is specified at entry to load, the X and
               Y registers stored in (C3) at entry are used as the starting ad-
               dress of the load—thus providing for a relocatable load. Then
               it receives bytes from the serial bus and stores or verifies them
               until the EOI status is received. Once the EOI status is re-
               ceived, the serial device is commanded to untalk, and the se-
               rial device sends the last buffered character. The serial device
               then is sent a CLOSE and told to untalk.
               
               For tape LOAD/VERIFY, the LOAD routine first checks if
               the tape buffer is located in memory >= 0200. If so, it loads
               the tape buffer with a header retrieved from the tape. If a file-
               name has been specified, a specific header with this filename
               is loaded; if there is no filename, it loads the next header on
               the tape. Only tape headers with tape identifiers of 1 or 3 are
               acceptable for LOAD/VERIFY. A tape identifier of 5 indicates
               an end-of-tape header, and in this case the routine will exit
               with carry set and accumulator set to 5. Tape identifiers of 2 or
               4 are for sequential files.
               
               A tape identifier of 3 causes a nonrelocatable load even if
               you have specified values in the X and Y registers at entry and
               a secondary address of 0. That is, you can't override a tape
               identifier of 3—it forces a nonrelocatable load.
               
               A tape identifier of 1 allows a relocatable load. If the tape
               identifier is 1 and the secondary address is 0, the X and Y reg-
               ister values at entry are used to determine the starting address
               for the load.
               
               For a nonrelocatable load, the starting address for the load
               is taken from the tape header. The ending address for the load
               (in both relocatable and nonrelocatable loads) is determined
               by adding the length of the program to the starting address.
               After determining whether to do a relocatable or non-
               relocatable load, it loads RAM from the next two program
               blocks on tape (two blocks are used for error correcting pur-
               poses; they should be identical copies of each other).

               This routine determines which device is being used for
               the load. Invalid devices are the screen, keyboard, or RS-232.
               Valid devices are serial devices or tape, and for these the rou-
               tine passes control to the appropriate serial or tape load
               routine.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. STA 93, thus setting the LOAD/VERIFY flag to 0 for LOAD
                  or to 1 for VERIFY.

               If entering at FE25/FE73, the carry flag determines
               whether the top of memory is being set or read. If the carry
               bit is clear, or if the routine is entered at FE2D/FE7B, the top
               of memory pointer (0283) is set from the X and Y register val-
               ues. If the carry is set, or if the routine is entered at

               JMP(031A) with a default of F34A/F40A.
               
               OPEN checks whether another logical file can be opened.
               Another logical file can be opened if the logical file number is
               not 0 and if fewer than ten logical files are already open.
               OPEN exits if trying to open to the screen or keyboard, as
               these devices do not use files.
               
               For a serial device, OPEN commands the serial device to
               listen and then sends a secondary address for OPEN to this
               serial device.
               
               For tape, OPEN checks for a tape header of a sequential
               file if reading, or writes a tape header for a sequential file if
               writing.
               
               The RS-232 OPEN initializes various RS-232 lines and
               creates two 256-byte buffers at the top of memory. RS-232
               OPEN handles the x-line handshaking opening sequence in-
               correctly on the VIC.

               **Called by**: Indirect JMP through (031A) from Kernal OPEN vector at
               FFC0.
               
               OPEN creates a logical file that can be used by Kernal
               I/O routines.
               
               OPEN first checks if the logical file number specified is 0.
               If it is 0, jump to the display the NOT INPUT FILE message
               and exit, as a logical file number of 0 is not permitted.
               
               If the number of files already open is less than ten and
               the logical file specified is not yet open, create entries in the
               logical file number table, device number table, and secondary
               address tables for this file. If a file already exists that uses the
               specified file number, the FILE OPEN error message is dis-
               played. If there are already ten open files, the TOO MANY
               FILES message is displayed.
               
               If the device is the screen or keyboard, exit as these de-
               vices do not use files. For RS-232-C, serial, or tape devices,
               jump or branch to their respective OPEN routines.
               
               **Operation**:
               
                1. If the logical file number is 0, JMP F70A/F78D to set error
                   message number of 6 (NOT INPUT FILE) and exit.
                2. JSR F30F/F3CF to see if the logical file number in B8, the
                   current logical file, is already present in the logical file
                   number table.
                3. If the logical file number is in the logical file number table,
                   JMP F6FE/F781 to set the error message number of 2
                   (FILE OPEN) and exit.
                4. LDX 98 to get the number of open files.
                5. If less than ten open files exist, continue with step 6. If ten
                   files are already open, JMP F6FB/F77E to set error mes-
                   sage number of 1 (TOO MANY FILES).
                6. Increment the number of open files, 98.
                7. Store the current logical file number in the logical file
                   number table, using the X register value from step 4 as an
                   index into the table at 0259.
                8. LDA B9, the secondary address, then ORA $60 in case a
                   secondary address is to be sent to a serial device. Store
                   this value in the secondary address table entry that corre-
                   sponds to the entry for this file in the logical file number
                   table.
                9. Store the current device number, BA, in the device number
                   table entry that corresponds to the entry for this file in the
                   logical file number table.
               10. If the current device is the keyboard or the screen, CLC
                   and RTS as there is no need to open files to these devices.
               11. If the current device is 1 or 2, branch to step 14. For de-
                   vices > 3, fall through to step 12.
               12.  JSR to F3D5/F495 to send secondary address in B9 to the
                  current device on the serial bus. The secondary address is
                   ORed with $F0 before sending to provide the secondary
                   address for OPEN. Return with carry clear if the serial de-
                   vice was present and the secondary address was sent with-
                   out errors. No error routine is called from OPEN if this
                   sequence fails.
               13. If the carry is clear on return from the JSR in step 12, exit
                   with carry clear. However, if the routine does not return
                   the carry clear to indicate the device was present and re-
                   sponded in time, OPEN does not branch to any error rou-
                   tine. This appears to be why you can open nonexistent
                   devices without getting an error until you actually try to
                   send or receive data for the device.
               14. If the device number is 2 (RS-232), JMP F409/F4C7 to
                   open an RS-232 device and RTS upon completion of the
                   RS-232 OPEN.
               15. If the device number is none of the above, it must be 1
                   (tape). Branch to F38B/F44B to open a logical file to tape.

               **Entry requirements**:
               Carry bit should be set or clear, depending on function desired:
               Set carry to read cursor location (X register = row, and Y
               register = column).
               
               Clear carry to set cursor location (X register = row, and Y
               register = column).
               
               JMP E50A (see screen routines in chapter 7).
               
               If the carry bit is clear at entry, move the cursor to the
               specified location. The contents of the the X register determine
               the new cursor row and the contents of the Y register deter-
               mine the new cursor column.
               
               If the carry bit is set at entry, read the cursor location and
               place the row value for the current cursor location into the X
               register and column value for the current cursor location into
               the Y register.
               
               The row number indicates the physical line, while the col-
               umn number indicates the column within a logical line. Valid
               physical line numbers in decimal are 0-24 (64) and 0-22
               (VIC). Valid logical column numbers in decimal are 0-79 (64)
               and 0-87 (VIC).
               
               
$FF87  RAMTAS  Memory initialization

               JMP FD50 to the Initialize Memory Pointers routine on
               the 64.
               
               At FD50 the routine stores $00 in locations 02-0101 and
               0200-03FF; sets the pointer to the tape buffer, (B2), to 033C;
               sets the pointer to the end of RAM + 1 in (0283), sets the
               pointer to the start of RAM in (0281), sets the screen memory
               page to $04.
               
               Although the VIC does not have a RAMTAS Kernal vec-
               tor, the corresponding operation on the VIC is done by JMP
               FD8D. At FD8D the routine stores $00 in 00-FF and 0200-
               03FF; sets pointer to tape buffer, (B2), to 033C; sets the pointer
               to the end of RAM + 1 in (0283); sets the pointer to the start
               of RAM in (0281); sets the screen memory page to $1E or $10
               depending on where RAM ends.
               
               The RAMTAS routine would mainly be used by an auto-
               start cartridge since the RAMTAS functions are normally exe-
               cuted during system reset.

               A0 is updated every 1/60 second. When the jiffy clock
               reaches a value equal to 24 hours, it is reset to 0.

               The 64/VIC Programmer's Reference Guides contain some
               errors:
               
               First, when VERIFYing for a serial device, a VERIFY error
               can occur.
               
               Second, for the VIC you cannot read the RS-232 status
               register, 0297, by calling this routine. READST for RS-232 al-
               ways returns zero on the VIC. If you want to read the RS-232
               status on the VIC, read 0297 directly; don't call this routine.
               This error in READST is corrected in the 64.
               
               Third, detecting an end-of-tape header allows BASIC to
               display the DEVICE NOT PRESENT error message, but the
               Kernal routines for OPEN or LOAD/VERIFY do not set loca-
               tion 90. Thus, READST will not return the end-of-tape status
               condition following OPEN or LOAD/VERIFY. You can check
               end-of-tape status upon return from OPEN or LOAD/VERIFY
               by checking for the carry bit set and the accumulator set to 5,
               which are the conditions that indicate end-of-tape.
               
               The table below shows the possible values returned by
               READST:
               
               ## READST Values
               
               | Hex Value | Bit | Serial I/O         | Tape Read/LOAD/VERIFY    | RS-232 (64 only)       |
               |-----------|-----|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
               | $80       | 7   | Device not present |                          | Break detected         |
               | $40       | 6   | EOI status         | End of file              | DSR signal missing     |
               | $20       | 5   |                    | Checksum error           |                        |
               | $10       | 4   | VERIFY error       | Unrecoverable read error | CTS signal missing     |
               | $08       | 3   |                    | Long block               | Receive buffer empty   |
               | $04       | 2   |                    | Short block              | Receive buffer overrun |
               | $02       | 1   | Read timeout       |                          | Framing error          |
               | $01       | 0   | Write timeout      |                          | Parity error           |
               
               ## Status Terms
               
               **Long Block**: Tape read is trying to read data bytes after the
               first block has already completed.
               
               **Short Block**: Tape read is reading leader bits between blocks
               while the byte action routine is still expecting to be reading
               bytes from the block.
               
               **Unrecoverable Read Error**: During tape read and
               LOAD/VERIFY, more than 31 errors were detected in block 1.
               This is also set if read or VERIFY errors for the same byte oc-
               curred in both blocks 1 and 2.
               
               **Checksum Error**: Computed parity for the loaded area is not
               the same as the final byte of tape block 2 (the parity computed
               during the SAVE of the second block).
               
               **End of File**: This status is set when doing CHRIN from tape
               for a sequential file and the read-ahead byte in the tape buffer
               
               **VERIFY Error**: The byte retrieved from the serial device does
               not match the byte in memory.
               
               **EOI (End or Identify)**: This is set during the Receive Byte
               from Serial Device routine when the EOI handshake is per-
               formed. Set during serial read to indicate the last byte has
               been sent from the serial device. The unusual term EOI is a
               holdover from the IEEE-488 bus definitions used on older
               PET/CBM computers; you may find it simpler just to remem-
               ber this as End of File for disk.
               
               **Device Not Present**: Device does not respond with the proper
               handshake sequence during OPEN, LOAD, VERIFY, or SAVE
               operations.
               
               **Read Timeout, Write Timeout**: Read or write timeouts are set
               when the serial device doesn't handshake within the allocated
               time.
               
               **Break Detected**: This is set if the check for a stop bit finds a 0
               rather than a 1, and the data bits received so far are all 0's.
               
               **Framing Error**: This is set if the check for a stop bit finds a 0
               and the data bits received so far included some bits set to 1.
               
               **DSR Signal Missing**: The 64 can't detect the Data Set Ready
               signal from the RS-232 device during x-line handshaking.
               
               **CTS Signal Missing**: The 64 can't detect the Clear To Send
               signal from the RS-232 device during x-line handshaking.
               
               **Parity Error**: The parity bit indicates an error in transmission
               of this byte.
               
               **Receiver Buffer Empty**: Nothing is in the RS-232 input
               buffer. This allows routines to test the status so they don't
               loop waiting for data.
               
               **Receiver Buffer Overrun**: The RS-232 input buffer is full and
               another byte has been received.
               
               
$FE07          Read/Set Status and Set Message Control FE07/FE57-FE20/FE6E
               
               **Called by**: JMP from Kernal READST vector at FFB7; alternate entry at
               FE18/FE66 by JMP from Kernal SETMSG vector at FF90;
               alternate entry at FE1C/FE6A by JSR at EDB2/EEB9 in Set
               Status Word, JSR at EE4F/EF4D in Receive Byte from Serial
               Device, JSR at F18A/F241 in CHRIN from Tape, JSR at
               F518/F5AF in Load/Verify from Serial Device, JSR at

               erable Read Error, JSR at FB8B/FBCC in Reset Vectors and
               Compute Checksum.
               
               If entering at FE07/FE57, determine the device number.
               For an RS-232 device, the VIC always stores 0 in the RS-232
               status word, 0297, and returns with accumulator set to 0,
               while the 64 correctly returns with the accumulator holding
               the value from 0297, and also stores 0 in 0297. For other de-
               vices, return with the value from 90, the I/O status, in the
               accumulator.
               
               If entering at FE18/FE66, store the contents of the accu-
               mulator in 9D, the Kernal message control flag. $80 sets
               Kernal control messages on, $40 sets Kernal error messages
               on, $C0 sets both Kernal control and error messages on, and
               $00 turns off all Kernal messages. Exit with the accumulator
               containing the value from 90, the I/O status word.
               
               If entry at FE1A/FE6A, then set 90, the I/O status, by
               ORing the accumulator with the current value of 90. The
               routines that call this entry point set the accumulator to a
               value for an I/O status.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. FE07/FE57: If the device number, BA, is not 2, branch to
                  step 4.
               2. If device number is 2 (RS-232): LDA 0297, PHA (64 only),
                  LDA $00, STA 0297, PLA (64 only), RTS.
               3. FE18/FE66: Store accumulator in 9D, the Kernal message
                  control flag.
               4. LDA 90, the I/O status.
               5. FE1C/FE6A: ORA 90. Thus, if the routine continues from
                  the instructions above, 90 is not changed. However, if the
                  alternate entry point of FE1C/FE6A is used, a new value
                  will result from this ORA.
               6. STA 90, updating the I/O status word if the alternate entry
                  point of FE1C/FE6A was used.
               
               
$FF8A  RESTOR  Reset RAM vectors to default
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               JMP FD15/FD52 to execute the routine to initialize the
               Kernal RAM vectors. This RAM vector initialization is also
               done during system reset.
               
               Calling this routine restores the vectors at (0314)-(0332)
               to their default values from the table at FD30/FD6D.
               
               
$FFD8  SAVE    Save contents of memory to device
               
               **Called by**: JSR at E15F/E15C in BASIC's SAVE.
               
               **Setup routines**: SETLFS, SETNAM (not required for saving to tape)
               
               **Entry requirements**:
               The accumulator should contain the offset within zero page to
                a two-byte pointer to the start of the area to be saved. The X
               register should hold the low byte of the address of the end of
               the area to be saved + 1. Y register should hold the high byte
               of the address of the end of the area to be saved + 1.
               
               JMP F5DD/F675 to save memory to a serial device or to
               tape. Saves to the screen, keyboard, or RS-232 are not permitted.
               
               If saving to tape from the VIC, only the contents of mem-
               ory locations 0-7FFF may be saved. This restriction does not
               apply when saving to tape from the 64.
               
               A filename is required (through SETNAM) when saving
               to serial devices; a filename is optional when saving to tape.
               
               At F5DD/F675 , the routine loads the pointer to the end
               of the save area + 1, (AE), from the X and Y registers. (End +
               1 denotes the fact that you must load X and Y to point to the
               location just past the end of the save area, since the save
               routines consider the save complete when the pointer to the
               save area equals the value of the pointer (AE).) It also sets
               (C1), the pointer to the start of the save area, from the zero
               page pointer indexed by the accumulator, and then performs
               an indirect JMP through the vector at (0332), which defaults to
               F5ED/F675.
               
               For a serial save, the routine commands the current serial
               device to listen with attention, then sends a secondary address
               of $61 to indicate a SAVE operation. If the device is present,
               the filename and the starting address are sent to the serial de-
               vice. Next, the routine sends all the bytes from the save area
               over the serial bus. When the save is complete, it sends a
               secondary address of $E1 to indicate the CLOSE command
               and commands the serial device to unlisten.
               
               For tape save, it is important that you specify the second-
               ary address correctly. For an even secondary address, the
               header for the saved program will have a identifier byte of 1,
               indicating a relocatable program. An odd secondary address
               produces a header identifier byte of 3, indicating a non-
               relocatable program. Also, if you have bit 1 on in the second-
               ary address ($02 or $03 would set bit 1), then an end-of-tape
               header with a identifier byte of 5 is written following the
               saved program.
               
               The tape save operation first writes a header to tape. This
               tape header contains the identifier byte, the starting address
               and ending address + 1 of the save area, and the filename (if
               a filename is used). Then data from the save area is written to
               tape. If bit 1 of the secondary address is 1, an end-of-tape
               header is also written following the data from the save area.
               Two identical copies of the tape header(s) and the program are
               written to tape to allow for error checking and correction dur-
               ing tape loading.
               
               
$F5DD          Jump to SAVE Vector F5DD/F675-F5EC/F684
               
               **Called by**: JMP from Kernal SAVE vector at FFD8.
               
               Set the pointer to the end of the save area + 1, (AE),
               from the X and Y registers.
               
               The accumulator value at entry is transferred to the X reg-
               ister and is used as an index into page zero for the location of
               two bytes that specify the starting address for the save. Set the
               pointer to the start address of the save area, (C1), from these
               two page-zero bytes.
               
               Jump to the address in the vector at (0322), normally
               F5ED/F685.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. STX AE, the low byte of the address of the end of the save
                  area + 1.
               2. STY AF, the high byte of the address of the end of the save
                  area + 1.
               3. TAX and LDA 00,X to get the low byte of the address of the
                  start of the save area, and STA in C1.
               4. LDA 01,X to get the high byte of the address of the start of
                  the save area, and STA in C2.
               5. JMP (0322) to the save routine. The default address in the
                  vector is F5ED/F685.

               If the current device is the keyboard or the screen, load
               the accumulator with 9 and set the carry bit to display the IL-
               LEGAL DEVICE NUMBER message, then exit.
               
               If the current device is either tape (1) or RS-232 (2),
               branch to Control Routine for Tape Save (which treats RS-232
               as an illegal device).
               
               If the current device is a serial device, fall through to the
               Save to Serial Device routine.
               **Operation**:
               1. If the current device is the keyboard or the screen, JMP
                  F713/F796 to display the ILLEGAL DEVICE NUMBER er-
                  ror message, set accumulator to 9, set carry, and exit. The
                  keyboard or the screen is not a valid device for saves.
               2. If the current device is RS-232 or tape, branch to
                  F659/F6F1, a routine that determines whether the save is to
                  RS-232 or tape. If RS-232 is specified, the ILLEGAL DE-
                  VICE NUMBER message is displayed. If the device is a tape
                  device, the tape save routines are executed.
               3. If the device is none of the above, its device number must
                  be >= 4; thus, it's a serial device. Fall through to Save to
                  Serial Device routine at F5FA/F692.

               JMP EA87/EB1E to the Keyboard Scan routine (see chap-
               ter 4) to check for a keypress. If a valid key is found down and
               the keyboard buffer is not full, the ASCII code value for the
               key is placed in the buffer.
               
               SCNKEY is useful if you have written a machine language
               program that runs with IRQ interrupts disabled, but you still
               want to scan the keyboard.
               
               
$FFED  SCREEN  Return number of columns and rows
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               JMP E505 to return the number of columns on the stan-
               dard display screen in the X register and the number of rows
               in the Y register. On the 64, the routine returns 40 in X and 25
               in Y. The VIC routine returns 22 in X and 23 in Y.
               
               A definitive way to let a program know whether it's run-
               ning on the VIC or the 64 is to JSR to SCREEN and test the
               values returned.
               
               
$FF93  SECOND  Send secondary address after listen to serial
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               **Setup routines**: LISTEN
               
               JMP EDB9/EEC0 to send the byte in the accumulator on
               the serial bus as a secondary address command with the serial
               attention output line set low. After this command is sent, the
               serial attention output line is brought high, the setting for
               transmitting normal data bytes.
               
               You must ORA the secondary address with $60 before
               calling this routine to convert the secondary address to a rec-
               ognized IEEE secondary address command. See page 378 of
               Raeto Collin West's Programming the PET/CBM for a detailed
               chart of the IEEE command groups.
               
               
$FFBA  SETLFS  Set logical file number, device number, and secondary address
               
               **Called by**: JSRs at E1DD/E1DA, E1F0/E1ED, and E1FD/E1FA in BA-
               SIC's Set LOAD/VERIFY/SAVE Parameters; JSRs at
               E22B/E228, E23F/E23C, and E24E/E24B in BASIC's Handle
               Parameters for OPEN and CLOSE.
               
               **Entry requirements**:
               The accumulator should hold the logical file number, the X
               register should hold the device number, and the Y register
               should hold the secondary address.
               
               JMP FE00/FE50 to set the logical file number, device
               number, and secondary address for a subsequent open, load,
               or save.
               
               The logical file number can be 1-255.
               
               The device numbers can be 0-31. Assigned device num-
               bers include 0 for the keyboard, 1 for tape, 2 for RS-232, 3 for
               the screen, and 4-31 for serial bus devices. By convention, se-
               rial device numbers 4 and 5 are usually used for printers and
               8-11 for disk drives.
               
               See the comments in the paragraphs on SAVE and LOAD
               routines about secondary addresses. An even secondary ad-
               dress gives a identifier byte of 1 for a relocatable program tape
               header. An odd secondary address gives a tape identifier of 3
               for a nonrelocatable program tape header. A secondary ad-
               dress that has bit 1 on (e.g., $02 or $03) produces an end-of-
               tape header with an identifier byte of 5.
               
               Secondary addresses >= 128 (decimal) will not be sent
               on the serial bus. For reading from serial, use an even second-
               ary address. For writing to serial, use an odd secondary ad-
               dress. Valid secondary addresses for serial devices are 0-31
               (decimal). If you specify a higher value, you may be sending a
               command other than what you intended, since secondary ad-
               dresses greater than 31 are used to represent commands to se-
               rial devices.
               
               
$FE00          Set Logical File Number, Device Number, Secondary Address FE00/FE50-FE06/FE56
               
               **Called by**: JMP from Kernal SETLFS vector at FFBA.
               
               In preparation for other Kernal I/O routines, this sets the
               logical file number, device number, and secondary address.
               
               Device numbers should range only from 0-31 (decimal).
               Serial commands such as OPEN, TALK, LISTEN, CLOSE, and
               others use bits 5-7 of the secondary address to specify the
               type of command. The commands do this ORA of the com-
               mand high nybble with the device number. Thus, a device
               number greater than 31 might result in an invalid command
               after the ORA.
               
               Also, if you specify a device number > 31, you do not get
               a device error until you actually try to send the device data (or
               retrieve data from it). This quirk is due to OPEN not checking
               for an invalid carry status after opening for a serial device.
               
               Normally, a secondary address >= 128 (decimal) in-
               dicates no secondary address is desired. However, for tape op-
               erations, 255 (or any odd value > 128) is the same as a
               secondary address of 3. See " Block SAVE and LOAD" by
               Sheila Thornton in COMPUTE!'s Second Book of VIC from
               COMPUTE! Books.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. STA B8, the logical file number.
               2. STX BA, the device number.
               3. STY B9, the secondary address.
               
               
$FF90  SETMSG  Set message control
               
               **Called by**: JSR at A47D/C47D in BASIC's Enable Kernal Control Mes-
               sages, JSR at A874/C874 in BASIC'S Disable Kernal Control
               Messages.
               
               **Entry requirements**:
               Accumulator should contain the value used to set message
               control: $80 allows Kernal control messages; $40 allows Kernal
               error messages; $C0 allows both Kernal control and error mes-
               sages; $00 disallows all Kernal messages.
               
               JMP FE18/FE66. This routine is called to determine which
               messages will be displayed in response to control or error con-
               ditions. The accumulator value at entry determines the setting
               of the message control status.
               
               Thanks to Russ Davies for pointing out that bits 6 and 7
               are reversed in describing how to set message control in the
               64 and VIC Programmer's Reference Guides.
               
               
$FFBD  SETNAM  Establish filename
               
               **Called by**: JSR at E1D6/E1D3 in BASIC's Set LOAD /VERIFY /SAVE
               Parameters, JSRs at E21B/E218 and E261/E25E in BASIC's
               Handle Parameters for OPEN and CLOSE.
               
               **Entry requirements**:
               Accumulator should contain the length of the filename. The X
               register should hold the low byte of the starting address of the
               filename. The Y register should hold the high byte of the file-
               name address. The filename may be stored at any addressable
               memory location.
               
               JMP FDF9/FE49 to prepare a filename for subsequent
               OPEN, LOAD/VERIFY, or SAVE processing. The accumulator
               value, the length of the filename, is stored in B7. The pointer
               to the filename from the X and Y registers is stored in (BB).
               
               Although you could create a filename that is 255 (deci-
               mal) characters long (the accumulator can hold a maximum
               value of $FF or decimal 255), not all of this maximum file-
               name size can be used.
               
               For tape, the filename is stored in the tape buffer, which
               is 192 bytes long. Flowever, 5 bytes are taken for the identifier
               and the starting and ending addresses, which leaves 187 bytes
               that can be used for the filename.
               
               One quirk with the serial devices is that if the secondary
               address you specify in SETLFS is larger than 128, the filename
               is not sent for OPEN, LOAD, or SAVE.
               
               
$FDF9          Set Filename Location and Number of Characters FDF9/FE49-FDFF/FE4F
               
               **Called by**: JMP from Kernal SETNAM vector at FFBD.
               
               The location of the filename is placed in a pointer at (BB),
               and the number of characters in the filename is placed in B7.
               
               This routine sets filename information for later use of the
               Kernal routines OPEN, SAVE, and LOAD. If no filename is
               needed for these routines, load the accumulator with zero
               before calling this routine. Flowever, loading or saving to a se-
               rial device requires that a filename be present.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. STA B7, the number of characters in the filename.
               2. STX BB, the low byte of the address of the filename.
               3. STY BC, the high byte of the address of the filename.
               
               
$FFDB  SETTIM  Set jiffy clock from registers
               
               **Called by**: JMP at AA1A/CA1A in BASIC's TI$.
               
               **Entry requirements**:
               The accumulator should hold the high byte to be stored in the
               jiffy clock. The X register should hold the middle byte to be
               stored in the jiffy clock. The Y register should hold the low
               byte to be stored in the jiffy clock.
               
               JMP F6E4/F767 to set the three-byte jiffy clock at A2-A0
               from the values in the accumulator, X register, and Y register.
               
               
$FFA2  SETTMO  Set IEEE time-out
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               JMP FE21/FE6F to store accumulator in 0285. The VIC-20
               Programmer's Reference Guide refers to this routine as setting a
               serial timeout flag and the Commodore 64 Programmer's Ref-
               erence Guide refers to it as setting a flag for IEEE timeout.
               However, neither BASIC nor the Kernal refers to this vector.
               Since 0285 is not a register for an I/O chip and it is never re-
               ferred to, it's hard to see how it can be used to enable or dis-
               able timeouts.
               
               
$FFE1  STOP    Test for STOP key

               Interrupt Handler (to find STOP and RESTORE).
               
               JMP (0328) with a default of F6ED/F770. At F6ED/F770,
               test 91 for the value $7F/$FE. Location 91 contains the key
               switch value of the STOP key column (column seven/three) of
               the keyboard scan. If $7E/$FE is found, set the Z flag of the
               status register to 1, call FFCC to reset I/O channels, and set
               C6, the number of characters in the keyboard buffer, to 0.
               
               If $7E/$FE is not found, the Z flag will be 0 on exit (BNE
               condition). In this case, the accumulator can still be tested for
               the keys shown below using the value shown following it.
               
               ## STOP Routine Return Values
               
               | Commodore 64 Key | Accumulator | VIC-20 Key  | Accumulator |
               |------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
               | 1                | $FE         | Cursor down | $7F         |
               | Left arrow       | $FD         | /           | $BF         |
               | CTRL             | $FB         | ,           | $DF         |
               | 2                | $F7         | N           | $EF         |
               | Space            | $EF         | V           | $F7         |
               | Commodore        | $DF         | X           | $FB         |
               | Q                | $BF         | Left SHIFT  | $FD         |
               
               If no key is down in the STOP column, the routine returns $FF
               in the accumulator (64 and VIC).
               
               
$F6ED          Test for STOP Key F6ED/F770-F6FA/F77D
               
               **Called by**: Indirect JMP through (0328) from Kernal STOP vector at FFE1.
               
               This routine is called to test whether the STOP key is be-
               ing held down. When the STOP key is found down, this rou-
               tine exits with the Z status flag set to 1, allowing the calling
               routine to test for this result with BEQ.
               
               Location 91 has the value of the keyboard scan for the
               STOP key column during the last IRQ or NMI interrupt.
               
               **Operation**:
               
               1. LDA 91.
               2. Check for the value that indicates the STOP key is pressed,
                  $7F/$FE.
               3. If STOP key is not pressed, then branch (BNE) to step 7 to
                  RTS with the accumulator containing last value in $91.
               4. If STOP key is pressed, then JSR FFCC (the Kernal
                  CLRCFIN vector) to clear serial I/O and reset default input
                  and output devices, returning with accumulator cleared to 0.
               5. STA C6, the number of characters in the keyboard buffer,
                  thus clearing the buffer.
               6. Restore the status of the comparison from step 2, thus
                  restoring Z to 1 (BEQ condition).
               7. RTS.

               where the serial device becomes the talker and the 64/VIC
               (and other devices on the serial bus) become the listener.
               
               The IEEE convention is that $6X and $7X represent
               secondary addresses. The 0-31(decimal) that you ORA with
               $60 before calling TKSA results in $6X if the accumulator
               holds 0-15 (decimal) and $7X if the accumulator holds 16-31
               (decimal). The VIC-1541 User's Manual states that the second-
               ary addresses can be 2-15 with 15 the command channel and
               0 and 1 reserved for load and save.
               
               
$FFEA  UDTIM   Increment jiffy clock
               
               **Called by**: JSR at EA31/EABF in IRQ Interrupt Handler.
               
               JMP F69B/F734 to update the jiffy clock at A2-A0 and
               store a value from the keyboard row for column number
               seven/three (which contains the STOP key) in 91 if a key in
               that row is detected.
               
               Normally, this routine is called by the IRQ interrupt han-
               dler (64 and VIC) or by the NMI interrupt handler (VIC only).
               However, if you run a program with IRQ interrupts disabled,
               you should call this routine if you want the jiffy clock in-
               cremented and the STOP key column value saved in 91.
               
               
$FFAE  UNLSN   Send unlisten to serial
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               JMP EDFE/EF04 to send $3F, the command for UNLISTEN,
               over the serial bus. Serial devices that are listening should rec-
               ognize the command and terminate their connection to the se-
               rial bus.
               
               
$FFAB  UNTLK   Send untalk to serial
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               JMP EDEF/EEF6 to send $5F, the command for UNTALK,
               over the serial bus. Serial devices that are talking should quit
               talking and terminate their connection to the serial bus.
               
               
$FF8D  VECTOR  Read or set RAM vectors
               
               **Called by**: None.
               
               **Entry requirements**:
               Carry should be set or clear, depending on the function
               desired:
               
               Set the carry bit to store the RAM vectors at
               (0314)-(0332) at the location pointed to by the X and Y
               registers.
               
               Clear the carry bit to load the RAM vectors at
               (0314)-(0332) from the location pointed to by X and Y.
               
               JMP FD1A/FD57 (see chapter 2).
               
               Store X and Y at (C3), the base address of where the vec-
               tor table will be read from or stored to.
               
               If the carry is set, store the RAM vectors at (0314)-(0332)
               to the location pointed to by the X and Y registers.
               
               If the carry is clear, load the RAM vectors at
               (0314)-(0332) from the location pointed to by X and Y.
