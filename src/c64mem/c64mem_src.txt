# This plain text file is formatted so that it can be automatically
# parsed in order to create cross-references etc.
# * Lines starting with "-" is top-level information. The first line
#   is the title. Lines starting with "--" are separators.
# * Lines starting with "#" are internal comments.
# * Hex addresses start at column 0.
# * Symbols start at column 13.
# * The description starts at column 21.
# * All lines of the description until the first blank line are
#   combined into the heading.
# * A '.' character at the end of a heading line represents a hard
#   line break.
# * The remaining text is in MarkDown format.
# * All addresses are 4 digits and have a leading '$'.
# The encoding is UTF-8.

                     In getting a pointer to a variable
                     it is important to remember whether it
                     is being done for "dim" or not.

                     DIMFLG and VALTYP must be
                     consecutive locations.

                     Turned on when "data"
                     being scanned by crunch so unquoted

                     this on before calling "PTRGET"
                     so arrays won't be detected.
                     "STKINI" and "PTRGET" clear it.
                     Also disallows integers there.
