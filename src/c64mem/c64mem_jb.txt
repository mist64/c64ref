# This plain text file is formatted so that it can be automatically
# parsed in order to create cross-references etc.
# * Lines starting with "-" is top-level information. The first line
#   is the title. Lines starting with "--" are separators.
# * Lines starting with "#" are internal comments.
# * Hex addresses start at column 0.
# * Symbols start at column 13.
# * The description starts at column 21.
# * All lines of the description until the first blank line are
#   combined into the heading.
# * A '.' character at the end of a heading line represents a hard
#   line break.
# * The remaining text is in MarkDown format.
# * All addresses are 4 digits and have a leading '$'.
# The encoding is UTF-8.
